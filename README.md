This is probably not the code you're looking for.


//TODO: 

- Add a linked list (probably for element items)
- finish implementing genres
- 'U' sort menu option
- work on # menu option

- make sure all implementations occur in cpp files (including constructors</br>
- add k (set genre) and l (list music by genre) options </br>
